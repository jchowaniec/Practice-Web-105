        After the video game crash in 1983, home consoles started losing in
        popularity giving rise to computers like the commodore. “While the games
        where crude and an embarrassment” some competitors would call them, they
        still gave rise to computers being used for more than just surfing the
        web.

      <p class="left-text">
        Computers allowed people to create their own games through code. This
        allowed many people to start developing different aspects in the gaming
        community. Some focused on art or graphic designs, some worked on
        different gameplay mechanics. Each of these different variations allowed
        the gaming community to grow to what it is today.
