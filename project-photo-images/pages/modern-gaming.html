        Now in our modern times, we have started branching out from 2d displays
        of gaming and started immersing ourselves into virtual reality. VR is
        actually an old concept, and the first working VR headset was created in
        1968 and was known as the “Sword of Damocles”. The reason for its name
        is that it was a really heavy structure that had to be supported by
        being attached to the ceiling. The graphics and interactions were
        primitive at best, but it was still a fully functioning prototype.

        After many various testing and upgrading, VR has risen to our current
        known models. The Oculus Quest was the first primary game-oriented VR
        headset. From the high-spec graphics to the quick response times, it
        truly allows you to feel like you can immerse yourself in the
        experience.
