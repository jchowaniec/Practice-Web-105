        The first example of a video game was created by Dr. Edward Uhler Condon
        at the New York World’s Fair in 1940. The game he made was called “Nim”,
        a 2 player game about removing objects from a pile until someone takes
        the last one. While this was the first example of a video game, home
        gaming wasn’t truly realized until 1967 when Ralph Baer released the
        Brown Box. This was basically the first home console for gaming, with
        programmable features and variation to play many different games such as
        pong, checkers, four different sports games, and the attachment known as
        “light gun”. From this console many more generations and variations into
        the newly established gaming world would be created.
